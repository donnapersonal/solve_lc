题目链接：[472.连接词](https://leetcode.cn/problems/concatenated-words/)

## 题目大意

给一个不含重复单词的字符串数组 `words`，请找出并返回 `words` 中的所有连接词 

连接词定义为：一个完全由给定数组中的至少两个较短单词（不一定是不同的两个单词）组成的字符串

```js
Example 1:
Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".

Example 2:
Input: words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]
Output: ["catdog"]
```

限制:
- 1 <= words.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
- words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of words are unique.
- 1 <= sum(words[i].length) <= 10^5
