# 410.分割数组的最大值

题目链接：[410.分割数组的最大值](https://leetcode.cn/problems/split-array-largest-sum/)

## 题目大意

给定一个非负整数数组 `nums` 和一个整数 `k`，需要将这个数组分成 `k` 个非空的连续子数组

设计一个算法使得这 `k` 个子数组各自和的最大值最小

```js
Example 1:
Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], k = 2
Output: 18
Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [1,2,3] and [4,5], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 9.
```

限制:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
- 1 <= k <= min(50, nums.length)
