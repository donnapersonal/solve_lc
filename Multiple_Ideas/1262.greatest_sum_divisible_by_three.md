# 1262.可被三整除的最大和

题目链接：[1262.可被三整除的最大和](https://leetcode.cn/problems/greatest-sum-divisible-by-three/)

## 题目大意

给你一个整数数组 `nums`，请找出并返回能被三整除的元素最大和

```js
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,6,5,1,8]
Output: 18
Explanation: Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
Output: 12
Explanation: Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
```

限制:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 10^4
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
