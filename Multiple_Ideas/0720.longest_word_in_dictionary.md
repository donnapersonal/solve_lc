## 题目大意

给一个整数数组 `nums` 和一个整数 `k`，请返回子数组内所有元素的乘积严格小于 `k` 的连续子数组的数目

```js
Example 1:
Input: words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation: The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".

Example 2:
Input: words = ["a","banana","app","appl","ap","apply","apple"]
Output: "apple"
Explanation: Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".
```

限制:
- 1 <= words.length <= 1000
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
- words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
