# 30.串联所有单词的子串

题目链接：[30.串联所有单词的子串](https://leetcode.cn/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/)

## 题目大意

给定一个字符串 `s` 和一个字符串数组 `words`，`words` 中所有字符串长度相同

`s` 中的串联子串是指一个包含 `words` 中所有字符串以任意顺序排列连接起来的子串

如，如果 `words = ["ab","cd","ef"]`， 那么 `"abcdef"`，`"abefcd"`，`"cdabef"`，`"cdefab"`，`"efabcd"`，和 `"efcdab"` 都是串联子串，`"acdbef"` 不是串联子串，因为他不是任何 `words` 排列的连接

返回所有串联子串在 `s` 中的开始索引，可以以任意顺序返回答案

```js
Example 1:
Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation:
The substring starting at 0 is "barfoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is "foobar". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.

Example 2:
Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
Explanation:
There is no concatenated substring.

Example 3:
Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]
Output: [6,9,12]
Explanation:
The substring starting at 6 is "foobarthe". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar","the"].
The substring starting at 9 is "barthefoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","the","foo"].
The substring starting at 12 is "thefoobar". It is the concatenation of ["the","foo","bar"].
```

限制：
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= words.length <= 5000
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
- s and words[i] consist of lowercase English letters
