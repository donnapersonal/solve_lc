# 983.最低票价

题目链接：[983.最低票价](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/)

## 题目大意

在一个火车旅行很受欢迎的国度，你提前一年计划了一些火车旅行。在接下来的一年里，你要旅行的日子将以一个名为 `days` 的数组给出。每一项是一个从 `1` 到 `365` 的整数

火车票有三种不同的销售方式 ：
- 一张`为期一天`的通行证售价为 `costs[0]` 美元
- 一张`为期七天`的通行证售价为 `costs[1]` 美元
- 一张`为期三十天`的通行证售价为 `costs[2]` 美元
  
通行证允许数天无限制的旅行。例如，如果在第 `2` 天获得一张`为期 7 天`的通行证，那么我们可以连着旅行 `7` 天：第 2 天、第 3 天、第 4 天、第 5 天、第 6 天、第 7 天和第 8 天

返回你想要完成在给定的列表 `days` 中列出的每一天的旅行所需要的最低消费 

```js
Example 1:
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total, you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.

Example 2:
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total, you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

限制:
- 1 <= days.length <= 365
- 1 <= days[i] <= 365
- days is in strictly increasing order.
- costs.length == 3
- 1 <= costs[i] <= 1000
