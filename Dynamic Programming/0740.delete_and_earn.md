# 740.删除并获得点数

题目链接：[740.删除并获得点数](https://leetcode.cn/problems/delete-and-earn/)

## 题目大意

给你一个整数数组 `nums`，可以对它进行一些操作

每次操作中，选择任意一个 `nums[i]`，删除它并获得 `nums[i]` 的点数。之后你必须删除所有等于 `nums[i] - 1` 和 `nums[i] + 1` 的元素

开始你拥有 `0` 个点数。返回你能通过这些操作获得的最大点数

```js
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.
```

限制:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
